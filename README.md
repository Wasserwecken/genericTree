# genericTree
This projekt is a private case study about abstracting the quad and octree process, to enable a generic leaf bounding boxes and a dimensional and position type lose implementation.

## Features
- Presets for a standard octree and quadtree
- Supports generic types for position and size
- Supports any bounding box for leafs
- Can be extended into any dimension

### Not included
- No presets for ray or complex intersections
- No presets for a higher dimensional tree


## Preset usage
The example uses the octree preset. Nevertheless the API and behaviour will exactly the same for the quadtree.   

### Initialisation
```c#

```
